# This workflow will build and push an application to a Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster when you push your code
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target AKS cluster
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set the following secrets in your repository (instructions for getting these
#    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-cli%2Clinux)):
#    - AZURE_CLIENT_ID
#    - AZURE_TENANT_ID
#    - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
#    - RESOURCE_GROUP
#    - CLUSTER_NAME
#
# 2. Choose the appropriate render engine for the bake step https://github.com/Azure/k8s-bake. The config below assumes Helm.
#    Set your helmChart, overrideFiles, overrides, and helm-version to suit your configuration.
#    - CHART_PATH (path to your helm chart)
#    - CHART_OVERRIDE_PATH (path to your helm chart with override values)
